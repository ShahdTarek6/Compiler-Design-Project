# Compiler Design Project

## Phase One: Scanner

### Introduction
Welcome to the first phase of our Compiler Design Project! In this phase, we delve into the foundational component of any compiler: the Scanner. 

### What is a Scanner?
Imagine the scanner as the first sentinel in our compiler fortress, tasked with discerning the raw source code into manageable lexical units called tokens. Much like a skilled detective, it sifts through the characters of the source code, identifying keywords, identifiers, literals, and punctuation marks, while filtering out the noise.

### Unveiling the Scanner
Our Scanner is more than just lines of code; it's the culmination of meticulous planning and creative problem-solving. Crafted with precision, it embodies the essence of our project's aspirations: to transform complex code into elegant tokens, paving the way for further compilation.

### Features
- **Tokenization:** Our Scanner excels in the art of tokenization, meticulously dissecting the source code into meaningful units.
- **Lexical Analysis:** With a keen eye for detail, it performs lexical analysis, distinguishing between identifiers, keywords, literals, and more.
- **Error Handling:** No detective is infallible, but our Scanner comes close. Equipped with robust error handling mechanisms, it gracefully handles unexpected characters and scenarios.
